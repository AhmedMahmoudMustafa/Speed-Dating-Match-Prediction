# Speed Dating Match Prediction

This project aims to predict the outcome of speed dating sessions based on the profiles of two individuals. The goal is to implement a recommendation system to better match people in speed dating events. The dataset used for this project is clean, but it contains a significant number of missing values. The strategy for missing value replacement needs to be tuned. Additionally, the dataset is highly unbalanced, with the majority of sessions resulting in no match.

## Problem Formulation

**Input**: Information about a speed dating session, including the profiles of two people.

**Output**: Probability (0-1) that the dating session will lead to a successful match.

**Data Mining Function**: Binary classification to predict the probability of a successful match.

**Challenges**: 
1. Handling missing values: The dataset has a lot of missing values, and an appropriate strategy for replacement needs to be determined.
2. Imbalanced dataset: The dataset is highly unbalanced, with a majority of unmatched sessions. This can lead to biased models that favor the majority class.
3. Feature selection: Choosing the most relevant features from the profiles to improve prediction accuracy.

**Impact**: By accurately predicting the outcome of speed dating sessions, we can develop a recommendation system that improves the matching process and increases the likelihood of successful matches. This can enhance the overall experience for participants and potentially lead to more meaningful connections.

**Ideal Solution**: An ideal solution would involve developing a machine learning pipeline that preprocesses the data, handles missing values effectively, selects informative features, trains a classification model, and optimizes the model's hyperparameters to achieve the best performance.

## Code Documentation

The code for this project should be properly documented with detailed comments to demonstrate understanding and clarity. Each step of the code should be explained, including the experimental protocol used and the preprocessing steps performed. This documentation will help others understand the code and replicate the workflow.

## Model Tuning and Documentation

To improve the model's performance, a data science lifecycle approach should be followed. Different features, hyperparameters, configurations, and even models should be explored. Each trial should be well-documented, including the reasoning behind the changes made, the expected outcomes, the observed performance, and thoughts on the results. The aim is to document the entire thought process and decision-making behind the trials, which will help in understanding the iterative improvements and overcoming challenges.
